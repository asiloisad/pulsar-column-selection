# column-selection

Create multiple selections across lines. A package allows you to drag across lines to select a column of text, with carets on each line. A few similar packages have already been released, but this one has applied important fixes:

- fixed a problem with inline HTML elements, e.g. [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen),
- fixed a problem with zone near end of file,
- fixed low performance when pressing `Ctrl`,
- fixed context menu when `Right Mouse Button` is used without modifier,
- fixed window switching with sticky mode,
- consider `core.multiCursorOnClick` configuration,
- added sticky mode with default shortcut `Alt-Q` (or `Left Mouse Button` on statusbar icon),
- turn off cursor-line background color while selecting,
- added status bar indicator for sticky mode,
- added picker mode `Ctrl-Q` (or `Right Mouse Button` on status bar icon) to selected region by sequence of 2 `Left Mouse Button`, optional `Ctrl` accepted or `Right Mouse Button` to break sequence,
- added edge text editor scrolling,
- added keyboard commands for single cursor movement.
