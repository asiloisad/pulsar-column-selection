A package allow you to drag across lines to select a column of text with carets on each line. A few similar packages has been already published, but this one has applied important fixes:

* fixed a problem of inline HTML elements, e.g. [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen),
* fixed a problem of zone near to end of file,
* fixed low performance if `Ctrl` is pressed,
* fixed context menu if `Right Mouse Button` without modifier is used,
* fixed window change with sticky-mode,
* consider `core.multiCursorOnClick` config,
* added sticky mode with preset shortcut `Alt-Q` (or `Left Mouse Button` on status-bar icon),
* added status-bar indicator of sticky mode,
* added picker mode `Ctrl-Q` (or `Right Mouse Button` on status-bar icon) to selected region by sequence of 2 `Left Mouse Button`, optional `Ctrl` accepted or `Right Mouse Button` to break sequence,
* added strict mode `Ctrl-Alt-Q` (or `Middle Mouse Button` on status-bar icon) to deal with selection behaviour if mouse start column is equal to mouse end column,
* keyboard commands of single cursor movement has been added.

## Notes

A package has been inspired by [Sublime Style Column Selection](https://github.com/bigfive/atom-sublime-select) and [slickedit-select](https://github.com/virtualthoughts/slickedit-select) packages, but decaffeinated and many problems has been resolved.
